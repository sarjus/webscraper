This Python script is a web scraper that extracts information from a website and creates a CSV file with the extracted data. Here's a breakdown of the code:

The script uses the requests library to send an HTTP GET request to the specified URL ('https://notes.ayushsharma.in/technology').
The response is then passed to BeautifulSoup (from bs4 import BeautifulSoup) to parse the HTML content of the page.
The script selects all the elements with the class name 'post-card' using the html.select method.
It iterates over each 'post-card' element and extracts information such as title, excerpt, and publication date.
The extracted data is then appended to a list my_data as a dictionary.
The script creates a Pandas DataFrame (pd.DataFrame) from the list of dictionaries.
The DataFrame is then written to a CSV file named 'output_with_headings.csv' using the to_csv method.
Note: Make sure you have the required libraries installed (requests, BeautifulSoup, and pandas) before running the script. You can install them using:# webscraper
