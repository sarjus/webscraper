# This Python script is a web scraper that extracts information from a website and creates a CSV file with the extracted data. 

1.  The script uses the requests library to send an HTTP GET request to the specified URL ('https://notes.ayushsharma.in/technology').
1.  The response is then passed to BeautifulSoup (from bs4 import BeautifulSoup) to parse the HTML content of the page.
1.  The script selects all the elements with the class name 'post-card' using the html.select method.
1.  It iterates over each 'post-card' element and extracts information such as title, excerpt, and publication date.
1.  The extracted data is then appended to a list my_data as a dictionary.
1.  The script creates a Pandas DataFrame (pd.DataFrame) from the list of dictionaries.
1.  The DataFrame is then written to a CSV file named 'output_with_headings.csv' using the to_csv method.
* Note: Make sure you have the required libraries installed (requests, BeautifulSoup, and pandas) before running the script. You can install them using:# webscraper
